### Introduction 
Hey! Thanks for learning about git. This will help you in your careers. Designers thanks for coming along, I swear this will be relevant for you too.

Iam _very_ excited to see what you build on GitHub.

```php 
    echo 'Coding is fun';
```

## Branches 
This project contains 3 typees of branches. Master is used for the production branch, Development is where we add new features, and new branches will be created to resolve our issues.

Never work directly on MASTER!
